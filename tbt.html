  <h4><u>Working at Height</u></h4>
  <p><u>This talk covers what you need to think about and do, before and during working at height</u></p>
  <p>All work at height must be properly planned. Around half of all fatalities on construction sites are as a result of falls from height</p>
  <h5>Hazards</h5>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>The incorrect selection or use of access equipment for the task is one of the biggest causes of falls from height. Never use the wrong piece of equipment just because that is all you have available.</li>
    <li>Adverse weather conditions must be anticipated and suitable precautions taken - beware of wet, windy or icy weather.</li>
    <li>Too much material on a working a working platfrom can make access difficult or make the platfrom unstable.</li>
    <li>Don't allow rubbish to accumulate. Use a chute or lower materials properly.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h5>Before working at height</h5>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>All work at height must be avoided where possible. If work at height cannot be avoided then a collective system to prevent falling (such as scaffolding, a MEWP or a mobile tower) should be used.</li>
    <li>All work at height must be carried out in accordance with the safe system of work provided.</li>
    <li>The consequences of any fall should be minimised by using an appropriate soft-landing system, net or - as a last resort - a safety harness</li>
    <li>The correct work equipment that is suitable for the task must be provided.</li>
    <li>All equipment provided must be inspected and maintained.</li>
    <li>Ensure you receive the correct information, instruction and training on the safe use of access equipment.</li>
    <li>Ensure you have the right skills, knowledge, training and experience for the job.</li>
    <li>Ladders and stepladders should only be used for light work of a short duration and where there is a low risk of falling.</li>
    <li>Fall protection (such as edge protection systems, barriers and perimeter scaffolds) should be installed to prevent the risk of materials or persons falling.</li>
    <li>Access ladders must extend at least 1M above the the stepping off point, be secured, and rest at the correct angle (one unit out to four units up or 75 degrees)</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h5>Safe working on roofs</h5>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fragile surfaces (such as cement roof sheets and skylights) must be identified with signs. Measures should be taken to stop you falling through a fragile surface</li>
    <li>A safe system of work must be devised and implemented where the roof would otherwise be liable to collapse under a person's weight. A temporary playform is normally used.</li>
    <li>If edge protection or a soft landing system cannot be used, it may be necessary to use a saftey harness and lanyard. A secure, designated anchorage point and training will be neccessary.</li>
    <li>Openings must have a securely fixed cover or guard; if removed for any reason, additional protection must be installed and the cover or guard replaced as soon as is practicable.</li>
    <li>Safe means of access must be provided (such as temporary staircases or fixed ladder with a gate).</li>
    <li>Bitumen boilers require a fire-resistant drip tray and appropriate fire extinguisher.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h4><u>Low-level access equipment (trestles, podiums and hop-ups)</u></h4>
  <p><u>Low-level access equipment is often misused, which can result in accidents. Being aware of the rules and following them can help to prevent a fall.</u></p>
  <p>This talk covers some diffrent types of low-level access equipment and how to use them safely</p>
  <h5>Folding and adjustable trestles</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>If a risk assessement show that they are suitable, they should only be used for light work and work of short duration.</li>
    <li>Guard-rails cannot generally be fitted to folding and adjustable trestles and so these should be avoided. if possible. The risk assessement must detail why a trestle without guard-rails is being used for the activity.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Modern trestle systems</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Modern trestle systems should be safe and stable in use, with safe ladder access, guard-rails and toe-boards fitted. Brick guards should be fitted where there is a risk of materials or tools falling and striking someone below. This is not the
      case for some older systemsm, which do not have many of requied safety features.</li>
    <li>Trestle systems are similar in usage and appearance to a low-level scaffold platform.</li>
    <li>A tied, secure ladder must be available for access to and from the trestle.</li>
    <li>Be aware of any weight restrictions before loading the trestle with materials.</li>
    <li>Ensure that boards are supported at the distances identified in the manufactor's instructions or information manual.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Podium steps and hop-ups</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Podium steps are commonly accepted as the replacement for stepladders; they provide a safe place to work from and can be moved easily.</li>
    <li>Training is important to understand their limitions, particularly about overreaching, surfing(pulling the mobile platforms along while standing on the platfrom), locking wheels and the use of stabilisers, if fitted.</li>
    <li>Hop-ups are small, flat platforms that provide extra height (up to 600 mm).</li>
    <li>If hop-ups are going to be used, a risk assessement will need to show that there is no other way to carry out the work safely.</li>
    <li>Where hop-ups are used, great care must be taken to ensure that the ground suraface is firm and stable and that a suitable and sufficient risk assessement is in place</li>
  </ul>

  <h4><u>Working on scaffolds</u></h4>
  <p><u>All work at height must be properly planned. Around half of all fatalities on construction sites are as a result of falls from height. If you don't follow guidance you may end up as a statistic or, at best, in hospital.</u></p>
  <p>This talk covers access requirments, loading, workplace hazards, inspections and security.</p>
  <h5>Access</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't climb up or down scaffolding tubes - use the lifts, ladders or stairs provided.</li>
    <li>Make sure the ladder is at the correct angle (one unit out to four units up or 75 degrees).</li>
    <li>The ladder should be free from damage and defects, and be secure and stable.</li>
    <li>At the end of the shift, remove the access ladders or board them up to prevent unauthorised access (for example, children playing on them).</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Loading</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't overload scaffolding. Position loads adjacent to the standards (not in the centre of bays) as they are the load-bearing members.</li>
    <li>When stacking materials, always leave a passageway at least two boards wide for other people to pass, or three boards wide if wheelbarrows are in use. Ensure that escape routes are kept clear so that they can be used in the event of an
      emergency.</li>
    <li>Ensure materials are stacked correctly, safely and can't fall. Consider the use of brick guards where there is a risk of materials falling and striking someone below.</li>
    <li>Don't leave tools or materials lying about on the working platform.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Hazards</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Guard-rails, toe-boards and brick guards must be fitted to places where people and work equipment or materials are liable to fall.</li>
    <li>Don't use incomplete scaffolding. Report any concerns to your supervisor or manager.</li>
    <li>Don't remove or interfere with ties, guard-rails, bracing and ladders. Alterations must only be made by competent persons.</li>
    <li>Don't throw, drop or tip materials from height. Materials must always be handled in a controlled and safe manner.</li>
    <li>The gap between toe-boards and mid guard-rails, and between mid and top guards-rails must not exceed 470 mm.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Inspection</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Carry out a quick visual check at the start of each shift before going on to the scaffold.</li>
    <li>Report any suspected faults or defects immediately.</li>
    <li>Scaffolding should be inspected at least every seven days, after alteration or modification, and after any event that may have affected its stability (such as high winds). These inspections must be carried out by a competent person and
      details of the Inspection must be recorded.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  <h4><u>Personal fall protection equipment</u></h4>
  <p><u>Serious injuries on site caused by falls are all preventable. Using personal fall protection equipment (PFPE) can save lives.</u></p>
  <p>This talk covers aspects that need consideration before, during and after the use of PFPE</p>
  <h5>Before Use</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>The use of PFPE should be considered to be a last resort. Other, more suitable, equipment should be used where possible. Factors to consider include the type of work, its location, how long it will take and how often it takes place. The risk
      assessement produced for the task should identify the type of equipment to be used.</li>
    <li>You should be trained in the use of the PFPE you are required to use (for example, fall restraint, work positioning, rope access or fall arrest).</li>
    <li>The equipment should be inspected to ensure that it is serviceable, suitable and fit for the task.</li>
    <li>You should be trained on how to carry out a pre-use check and the sorts of faults you should be aware of.</li>
    <li>You should be briefed on the task to be carried out, including details about the designated anchor points you can use and the limitations of the equipment in question.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Safe Use</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>You must not misuse any equipment that is provided for your safety.</li>
    <li>You must report any defects immediately so the equipment can be withdrawn from use. Do not make running repairs.</li>
    <li>You must only use designated anchor points that you have been instructed to use.</li>
    <li>The safe system of work must include a detailed rescue plan and first-aid arrangements.</li>
    <li>PFPE Must be formally inspected by a competent person at the following minimum frequencies
      <ul>
        <li>Every six months for normal use</li>
        <li>Every three months for arduous conditions, enviroments or occupations.</li>
        <li>Interim inspections, as determined through a risk assessement.</li>
        <li>Installed systems (horizontal and vertical lines), as per the manufactorer's recommendations</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h5>After Use</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>All equipment is to be inspected for damage and must be clean and dry before being put away.</li>
    <li>Any defects with the equipment are to be reported promptly and correctly.</li>
    <li>Adequate records of the conditions and usage of the equipment should be maintained.</li>
  </ul>
