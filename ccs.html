  <h3>Relevent Spotlights</h3>
  <h4>Mental Health,</h4>
  <p>Mental health is defined as <em>a state of wellbeing in which the individual realises their own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productivly and fruitfully, and are able to make a contribution to their
      community</em></p>
  <p>Mental ill health is when someone devlops a diagonsable problem related to their mental health, such as an anxiety disorder, depression, or an eating disorder, or experiences less severe symptoms such as low mood or mild anxiety which could
    worsen if ignored. Stress is a fact of life for many people, but it can also be the cause of/the result of mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and eating disorders.</p>
  <p>Mental ill health can not only have an impact upon work performance and personal lives, but also impact people physically through poor physical health including high blood pressure, stomack ulcers, and increased risk of heart attacks as well as
    risk of drugs and alcohol abuse</p>
  <p>In construction stress, anxiety and depression can often develop from heavy work loads, long working hours, travel, family seperation, fear of redundancy and job insecurity, financial and budgeting pressures, tight deadlines and high risk
    activities. The male dominated nature of construction and the stereotypical image of the tough male who does not show emotion can lead to people feeling alone and not voicing their struggles</p>
  <h5>Facts and figures - </h5>
  <ul>
    <li>1 in 4 people will experience a mental health problem in any given year</li>
    <li>9 out of 10 people who experience mental health problems say they face stigma and discrimination as a result</li>

    <li>In 2016/17, 12.5 million working days where lost to work-related stress, depression or anxiety, an average of 23.8 days lost per case</li>
    <li>Work related stress, depression and anxiety is estimated to cost constructione employers £178 million per annum, equating to £15,000 per case</li>
    <li>A construction workere is more likely to die of suicide than they are from a fall from height</li>
    <li>People working in construction are 63% more likely to die by sucide than the national average</li>
    <li>1 in 4 construction workers have considered suicide</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>What can you do?</h5>
  <p>If there is someone in your life who you know or belive is dealing mental health issues here are some points that you can use to help support them</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Set time aside with no distractions</strong> - It is important to provide an open and non-judgmental space with no distractions.</li>
    <li><strong>Let them share as much or as little as they want to</strong> - Let them lead the discussion at their own pace. Don't put pressure on them to tell you about anything they aren't ready to talk about. Talking can take a lot of trust and
      courage. You might be the first person they have been able to talk to about this.</li>
    <li><strong>Don't try to diagnose or second guess their feelings</strong> - You arn't a medical expert and, while you may be happy to talk and offer support, you aren't a trained counsellor. Try not to make assumptions about what is wrong or jump
      in too quickly with your own diagnosis or solutions.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep questions open ended</strong> - Say "why don't you tell me how you are feeling?" rather then "I can see you are feeling very low". Try to keep your language neutral. Give the person time to anwser and try not to grill them with
      too many questions.</li>
    <li><strong>Talk about wellbeing</strong> - Talk about ways of de-stressing or practicing self-care and ask if they find anything helpful. Exercising, having a healthy diet and getting a good nights sleep can help protect mental health and
      sustain wellbeing.</li>
    <li><strong>Listen carefully to what they are telling you</strong> - Repeat what they have said back to them to ensure you have understood it. You don't have to agree with what they are saying, but by showing you understand how they feel, you are
      letting them know you respect their feelings.</li>
    <li><strong>Offer them help in seeking professional support and provide information on ways to do this</strong> - You might want to offer to go to the GP with them, or help them talk to a friend or family member. Try not to take control and allow
      them to make decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Know your limits</strong> - Ask for help or signpost if the problem is serious. If you believe they are in immediate danger or they have injuries that need medical attention, you need to take action to make sure they are safe.</li>
