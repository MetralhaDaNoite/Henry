  <h3>Fire Plan</h3>
  <p>In the event of a fire (or any situation that requires the evacuation of the site) all blocks will sound a fire alarm, when this happens, we expect everyone to follow the standard procedure -
    <li>Drop what you are doing</li>
    <li>If you are in a block, proceed down the stairs and do not use the hoists/lifts</li>
    <li>If you are a supervisor or are responsible for any operatives make sure they are aware of the situation and following the correct procedure</li>
    <li>Exit the site in a calm and orderly manner <strong>DO NOT RUN</strong></li>
  <p>~There are three exits that you can use to leave the site. These are as follows: The Primary Delievery Gate - Located by Block 3 on the westside of the hoarding, The Secondary Delievery Gate - Located by Block 2 on the westside of the hoarding,
    The Turnstiles - Located by the Main Office on the northside of the hoarding~</p>
  <li>Gather outside the site at the <strong>Firepoint</strong> (this will be the <strong>Queen's Garden</strong>) located on the northside of the site</li>
  <li>Wait at said <strong>Firepoint</strong> till a manager provides further instructions</li>
  </p>

  <h3>First Aid/Incidents</h3>
  <p>
    First aid kits can be found in the Main office (as well as the subcontractor office's -these will be in block 3 and in the basement for block 2- however your best bet will be the Main office). If you are injured please do come up to the Main
    Office and let us know, so that we can provide you with first aid - if the injury is serious we will make sure you get to the nearest hospital to get the necessary treatment. We will also typically have a first aider up in the Main office.
    A few of the first aiders that we have on site are as follows -</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Filipe Navarro - 07931051564</li>
    <li>Trevor McClintlock - 07849787291</li>
    <li>Matt Thorpe - 07487851261</li>
    <li>Paul Edwards - 07941546746</li>
    <li>Elisei Haidu - 07450957735</li>
    <li>Kevin Kilduff - N/A</li>
    <li>Paul Wilson - 07956216482</li>
  </ul>
  <p>While we are on the topic of First Aid & Incident's I would like to mention that if you see anything that could be classed as a near miss (for example if a brick or hammer falls from a height but no one is injured) please take 5 minutes out of
    your day and let us know so that we can prevent it from happening again in the future.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Canteen</h3>
  <p>On site we have 3 Canteen's that can be used</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Main Canteen - Hold's 26 people</li>
    <li>Canteen opposite Main - Hold's 8 people</li>
    <li>Finally Canteen first door on your right (coming from turnstiles/block 4) - Hold's 8 people</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When entering the Canteen's you will notice that the tables have some tape on their surfaces, this is there to keep people more separated while everyone is eating (two people per table). You can get hot meals from the Main
    Canteen -however
    please keep in mind that you can only pay in cash so if you only have card you will need to take out money before hand- once you have your meal you can take it to one of the other canteens, or eat out in the public however if you choose to do
    this since youd be in a public area we ask that you are mindful and respectful as we are not the only ones using the space</p>
